# 🏨 Hotel Analytics: SQL Insights & Python Visualizations

This project explores and visualizes hotel operational data using SQL for data extraction and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for analytics and visualization. It answers key business questions related to customer behavior, complaints, room occupancy, and revenue generation.

## 📊 Project Objectives

This project addresses the following business questions:

1. 📌 Identify relationships among all tables in the dataset
2. 👥 Determine total number of unique customers
3. 🛏️ Calculate the room occupancy rate
4. 🧾 Analyze the distribution of customer complaints room-wise
5. 🗣️ Identify key complaints in customer feedback
6. 🔁 Calculate the customer retention rate
7. 📍 Identify the total number of complaints for each room
8. 🌍 Analyze region-wise breakdown of offers and engagement
9. 💰 Calculate revenue for each room

## 📁 Project Files

- `Solutions.sql`: SQL queries to extract and analyze data
- `Python visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data visualization
- `question.pdf`: List of key analytical business questions

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL Server**
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
